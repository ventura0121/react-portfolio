# Portfolio
This is my second attempt of creating a personal portfolio. After finishing General Assembly's software immersive program, I wanted to redo my portfolio and showcase the additional skill sets I picked up towards the end of the program. Any additional personal projects I work on will be uploaded to my portfolio.
