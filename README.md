# Portfolio
This is my second attempt of creating a personal portfolio. After finishing General Assembly's software immersive program, I wanted to redo my portfolio and showcase the additional skill sets I picked up towards the end of the program. Any additional personal projects I work on will be uploaded to my portfolio. 

## User Stories
As a viewer, I want to see the website portray clean, organized, and easily accessible information to be able to understand what the purpose is. I want to see links for additional information about this person. 

As a hiring manager, I want to see past experience the type of projects this person is capable of completing and how much work has been put into self development after bootcamp. 

As a friend, I want to see all the cool things my friend has built to show to potential employers

As a family member, I want to see what Felipe has learned to do after his time in General Assembly BootCamp.
